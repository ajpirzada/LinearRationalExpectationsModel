# Rational Expectations model
This project shows how to use Chris Sim's gensys algorithm to solve a linear rational expectations model. 

## Usage

- The file $\textit{REmodelToolkit.py}$ includes the Python version of Chris Sims gensys algorithm.
- The file $\textit{NKmodelSimulations.ipynb}$ esets up a three equation New Keynesian model in the form that is consistent with the gensys alogorithm. It then uses the algorithm to solve the model.
- You should have both the files in the same folder before running the file $\textit{NKmodelSimulations.ipynb}$.

### Running the code in Google Colab

1. Go to your google drive (online).
2. Under My Drive, there will be a folder called Colab Notebooks. If not, create one.
3. Upload both the files to this folder. Make sure that you upload the toolkit file with exactly the same name i.e. $\textit{REmodelToolkit.py}$.
4. Open the $\textit{NKmodelSimulations.ipynb}$ file.
5. Connect and run the cells under SET PATH FOR TOOLKIT IN GOOGLE DRIVE.
6. Import the libraries.

You are good to go!

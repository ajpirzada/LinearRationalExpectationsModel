# Rational Expectations model
This project shows how to use Chris Sim's gensys algorithm to solve a linear rational expectations model. 

## Usage
- The file $\textit{REmodelToolkit.py}$ includes the Python version of Chris Sims gensys algorithm.
- The file $\textit{NKmodelSimulations.ipynb}$ sets up a three equation New Keynesian model in the form that is consistent with the gensys alogorithm. It then uses to algorithm to solve the model.
